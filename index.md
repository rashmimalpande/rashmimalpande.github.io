I am a web developer with 8 years of hands-on experience in the dynamic world of web technologies. Over the years, I have worked on a variety of tools and technologies which includes frontend languages such as **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React JS**, **Vue.js** and server-side languages such as **PHP**, and **Node.js**. 

Beyond the code, I'm fueled by a passion for problem-solving and puzzles. I thrive on the challenge of untangling complex issues and finding elegant solutions, whether it's in my code or in a Sudoku puzzle.

When I'm not coding, you'll often find me buried in a book, exploring new worlds and ideas, binge-watching the latest movies and TV shows. Music is my constant companion, providing the soundtrack to both work and play.

I am eager to share the knowledge & insights I have gained over the years and help others grow.

Let's connect and embark on this journey together, making the web a better place one line of code at a time!
